Out-the-box, it\u2019s a single mechanical key switch with Bluetooth support, powered by an ultra-lightweight battery that delivers 10\u201330 days of life, depending on usage. The Arduino-compatible ESP32C6 chip also opens the door for custom Bluetooth and WiFi firmware projects. </p> <p>That said, there\u2019s a quirk unique to this First Edition model, due to a limitation in the XIAO chip design\u2013 the power-down switch doesn\u2019t completely stop battery drain. Even when switched off, the MONOKEY draws a small amount of power. For the best battery life, we recommend leaving it in deep sleep mode, where it can last up to 30 days, compared to 10 days when using the power-down switch.</p> <p>Effectively, in this version, the power switch functions more as a reset switch than a true shutoff. Deep sleep is activated automatically by leaving the MONOKEY untouched while powered on for 15 minutes. In the new year, we\u2019ll be working on an in-house solution to perfect this for MONOKEY v2, aiming to introduce a power switch with near-zero current drain.</p>"},{"location":"#support-channels","title":"Support channels","text":"<ul> <li>Discord: https://discord.gg/S4Qqz2ZqWm</li> <li>Email: bigbadcult@gmail.com</li> </ul>"},{"location":"monokey/","title":"MONOKEY","text":""},{"location":"monokey/#quick-start","title":"Quick Start","text":""},{"location":"monokey/#user-guide","title":"User Guide","text":""},{"location":"monokey/#bluetooth-pairing","title":"Bluetooth Pairing","text":""},{"location":"monokey/#key-mapping","title":"Key Mapping","text":""},{"location":"monokey/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":""}]}
