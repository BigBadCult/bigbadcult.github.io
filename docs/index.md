# Welcome to the Big Bad Cult 

Congratulations on being the proud owner of BigBadCult’s __MONOKEY™–First Edition__. It's the first of its kind, and it's now yours. With only 500 pieces in production, you hold a truly unique relic of the CULT—each laser-etched with a serial code that identifies yours as one-of-a-kind.

##What’s Next?
The CULT engineers have temporarily stepped away from the lab, taking an intermission for year-end festivities and a quick recharge. When we return, the gears will be turning once again and here’s what you can look forward to:

* __Documentation__ —
This page will soon feature a comprehensive user guide, including an operation manual, key mapping instructions, custom firmware instructions, troubleshooting tips, and more.

* __Firmware Enhancements__ —
Improved sleep mode to further extend battery life.
Hardware key mapping—remap any key or create custom key sequences, all stored directly on the MONOKEY hardware.

* __Software Development__ —
A tool for customizing hardware keycode.
Support for programming key sequences.
Support for programming mouse sequences.

* __Hardware v2__ —
We'll be drafting improvements for MONOKEY v2. As First Edition backers, your feedback is invaluable, and we’d love to hear your thoughts on how to make it even better. When v2 launches, you’ll also receive an exclusive discount as a token of our gratitude.

##A note about this model
Every detail of this First Edition MONOKEY was meticulously designed. Out-the-box, it’s a single mechanical key switch with Bluetooth support, powered by an ultra-lightweight battery that delivers 10–30 days of life, depending on usage. The Arduino-compatible ESP32C6 chip also opens the door for custom Bluetooth and WiFi firmware projects. 

That said, there’s a quirk unique to this First Edition model, due to a limitation in the XIAO chip design– the power-down switch doesn’t completely stop battery drain. Even when switched off, the MONOKEY draws a small amount of power. For the best battery life, we recommend leaving it in deep sleep mode, where it can last up to 30 days, compared to 10 days when using the power-down switch.

Effectively, in this version, the power switch functions more as a reset switch than a true shutoff. Deep sleep is activated automatically by leaving the MONOKEY untouched while powered on for 15 minutes.
In the new year, we’ll be working on an in-house solution to perfect this for MONOKEY v2, aiming to introduce a power switch with near-zero current drain.
